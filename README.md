## Sidebar demo 
with
1. `react`.`tsx`
2. `esbuild`
3. `scss`
4. `pnpm`
5. `iconfont`

a expandable sidebar with css
add className `close` for the preset css\
then the `.close>text` are not display

copy the css from another [demo](github.com/Call-me-phoenix/sidebar),\
and combine it with esbuild ,scss ,react ,pnpm.

## other issue
just wonder how to use `turbopack` without using `nextjs@13`,\
can not find any detail about it.\
they all tell you to construct with `nextjs@13`,
but i just want to pack this small demo


## later 
maybe add dark mode part
